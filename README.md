# Typing Speed Test

A simple Python-based **Typing Speed Test** app built using the `Tkinter` library. This app allows users to test their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and stores the highest typing speed in a file called `highscores.txt`.

## Features

- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Measures your typing speed based on how quickly you can type a sample sentence.
- **High Score Tracking**: Stores and displays your highest WPM in a file (`highscores.txt`).
- **Random Sample Texts**: A variety of sentences to type, ensuring a dynamic typing experience each time you use the app.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included by default in most Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typing-speed-test.git
   cd typing-speed-test
   ```

How to Use
Typing: You will be presented with a random sentence to type.

1)Start the Timer: The timer starts automatically when you start typing.

2)Submit: When you're finished typing the sentence, click the Submit button.

3)Typing Speed: The app will display your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

4)High Score: The highest WPM ever recorded will be displayed, and the file highscores.txt will store this value for future sessions.

High Score File (highscores.txt)
The app keeps track of your highest typing speed across sessions by saving it to a file called highscores.txt. The file will be created automatically if it doesn't already exist.
